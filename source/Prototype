Based on the assessment, determine the most suitable migration strategy for the specific infrastructure. This may involve a lift-and-shift approach, where the entire infrastructure is moved to Azure with minimal changes, or a modernization approach, where applications and services are re-architected for cloud-native deployment.
Choose the right Azure services: Once the migration strategy is determined, identify the specific Azure services and resources needed to support the migrated infrastructure. This may include virtual machines, storage, networking, databases, and security services.
Prepare the environment: Before migrating to Azure, ensure that the target environment is properly set up and configured. This includes creating an Azure account, setting up the appropriate Azure services and resources, and configuring security and access controls.
Migrate the infrastructure: Once the environment is set up, begin migrating the on-premises infrastructure to Azure. This may involve migrating applications, data, and systems to Azure, and testing them to ensure that they are working as expected.
Optimize and manage the Azure environment: After migrating to Azure, continue to optimize and manage the environment to ensure that it's running efficiently and effectively. This may involve tuning applications and services, monitoring the environment for performance and security, and applying updates and patches as needed.
Evaluate and refine the Azure environment: Finally, regularly evaluate the Azure environment to ensure that it's meeting the needs of the organization. This may involve gathering feedback from users, assessing the effectiveness of the infrastructure, and refining the environment to improve performance, security, and cost-effectiveness.
